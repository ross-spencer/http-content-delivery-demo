# http-content-delivery-demo

A demo of server content delivery enabling users to select HTTP response headers
for themselves.

Primary purpose is to observe the effect of different HTTP response headers in
various browsers after discovering quite wildly different behaviours in Internet
Explorer vs. Chrome when delivering binary content 'inline'. This approximates
the delivery of files from the Rosetta Long Term Preservation system v4.0.1 at
least.

## To run:

```sh
$go build
$http-content-delivery-demo
2017/01/19 11:28:31 Server listening on port 2040.
```

Access the site in a web-browser with: http://127.0.0.1:2040
