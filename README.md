# ðŸ“¬ HTTP Content Delivery Demo ðŸ“¬

A demo of server content delivery enabling users to select HTTP response headers
for themselves.

Primary purpose is to observe the effect of different HTTP response headers in
various browsers after discovering quite wildly different behaviours in Internet
Explorer vs. Chrome when delivering binary content 'inline'. This approximates
the delivery of files from the Rosetta Long Term Preservation system v4.0.1 at
least.

## To run

### Set the file modification dates

The content server should deliver files with dates older than `$TODAY`. We can
achieve that using the `touch` command. More info [here][touch-1].

There is a small script included in this demo which will set all the dates for
the sample files to `1970-01-01`:

```sh
#! /usr/bin/bash

set -eux

echo "setting time and date on files"
 $(TZ=UTC touch -a -m -t 197001010000.01 file1.tga)
 $(TZ=UTC touch -a -m -t 197001010000.01 file2.rtf)
 $(TZ=UTC touch -a -m -t 197001010000.01 file3.txt)
 $(TZ=UTC touch -a -m -t 197001010000.01 file4.ppp)
 $(TZ=UTC touch -a -m -t 197001010000.01 file5.ai)
echo "done"
```

Run `./touch-all.sh` which already includes these commands. If you need to set
the script's permissions, simply: `chmod +x touch-all.sh`.

### Building and running the server

A simple golang app can be built and run with the commands below:

```sh
$go build
$http-content-delivery-demo
```

You should see output such as:

```txt
2023/11/02 21:40:47 Server listening on port 2040.
```

Access the site in a web-browser with: http://127.0.0.1:2040
